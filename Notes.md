# Notes

This is just a place to put a plan and idea dump for this project.

---

So what we need to do here is to create fuzzers to generate dummy data for testing validators.

most of the kinds of data we need are hashes for credentials and policies, and integers for quantities.

with that in mind I will focus on create tuples and lists of these kinds of values.

this will include assets, addresses, outputreferences etc.
